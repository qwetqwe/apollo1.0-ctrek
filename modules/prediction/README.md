# Prediction

## Introduction
  The prediction module receives the obstacles from the perception module with 
  their basic perception information including positions, headings, velocities, 
  accelerations, and generates the predicted trajectories with probabilities 
  for the obstacles.

## Input
  * Obstacles from the perception module (future work)

## Output
  * Obstacles additionally with predicted trajectories (future work)
